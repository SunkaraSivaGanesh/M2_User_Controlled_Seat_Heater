# M2_User_Controlled_Seat_Heater

## Introduction
   
Now a days world is facing problem with cooling issue due to weather conditions because of that the vechicle seats are getting cold and making the user drive the vechile uncomfortably , So inorder to resolve this issue we have come up with an idea that is seat heater controlled by the user.

So in this Generation everything is becoming automated and everyone is looking for the new products to made the life easier.

In our project the main aim is to design and develop the system which is capable of monitoring the user's existance and Heat Monitoring.

## Benefits
Heated seats can make cars much more comfortable in the winter, or for those who often get cold even in the summer. The heater in most vehicles work well, but the car’s seat warmer is close to your body allowing you to warm up faster. In some cases, the seat warms up before the rest of the vehicle does.

## Features
* If the user in side the car than switch is ON
* user was existed in the vehicle it will gives the indication
* After the indication it will determine the heat.
* Driver and the user can have the access to modifying the temperature in the vehicle.
* The user can modify the temperature by watching the display as the display is given in the system.

## Used components

* Temperature sensor
* switches
* led for indication
* potential Switch
* resister

# SWOT Analysis- Strengths, and Weakness, Opportunities threats

## Strengths

* User Friendly.
* Easy to modify the temperature value
* The system is robust
* Low cost.

### Weakness

* It's only applicable for the countries which are having having low temperature.
* If you do not follow the recommendations and go too far with the temperature, this can lead to a decrease in the driver’s attentiveness, cause fatigue and headaches, and also increase the risk of catching a cold due to a violation of the body’s temperature regime.

## Opportunities

* The advanced technologies in automotive seat heaters are predicted to increase the growth of the market in the review period.
* Growing demand for comfort and energy capabilities in vehicles is accelerating market growth.
* It can be implemented by adding heater along with air conditioners so that it will be helpful all the countries.

## Threats

* Not suitable for high temperature environment.
* A lack of regulation for these seats has left consumers more open to injuries.
* High electrical resistance could cause the heater pad in the seat to overheat
